# Stock Price Analyzer

A stock price always fluctuates, but is there a relation between a closing price and its moving averages?

This projects aims to show case how the stock would move. In this project I selected 5 years of TESLA stock price data to perform the analysis.


### Objective:
The objective of this project is to find the possible futuristic movement of the stock 'TSLA' based on its price for the last 5 years.

#### Note:
The stock (TESLA) and the period of 5 years have been chosen randomly any other stock or period of time can be used for the analysis.
